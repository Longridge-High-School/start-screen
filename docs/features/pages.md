# Pages

Star Screen has a pages system that allows you to create _simple_ or full pages.

Both types of page are compiled as [MDX](/guides/working-with-mdx) allowing full
customisation. A _simple_ page provides a rounded white box around the content
to make text only pages easy to make.

Pages can also be limited to _Staff_ only so you can create pages with content
that you don't want students to have access to.
