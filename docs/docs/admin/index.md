# Admin

The admin panel contains all the admin functions for Start Screen.

> Shortcuts are not in the admin panel as they are designed to be used by all
> staff.

## User Debugger

The User Debugger is on the index page of the Admin Panel and allows you to
search for a user to find out what type of user they are, and what scopes they
have.
